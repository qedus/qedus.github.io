      <h2>Using threading to parallelise Google App Engine Search Service</h2>
<p class="meta">27 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I ran into a performance/cost bottleneck with some of my code that uses the experimental App Engine Search Service. It currently does not let you asynchronously put documents into its search indexes, therefore I was getting the following display in App Stats when trying to insert 20 documents at a time:</p>

<p>The whole task took over 4 seconds to execute with each document insertion being done sequentially. Note the datastore<em>v3.Put commands also add 20 entities at a time but use ndb.put</em>multi_async() to ensure they only use one RPC. It is executed in milliseconds.</p>

<p>With the python 2.7 runtime I changed my code to use threading.Thread for each of the document insertions and saw a big performance improvement:</p>

<p>The task now takes under 3 seconds which means I can run with fewer instances which in turn costs me less. Ideally there would be a search.Index(name=’index-name’).put<em>multi</em>async() in the Search Service API but this is the next best thing.</p>
