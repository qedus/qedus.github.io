I recently visited Vietnam, a country that uses scooters as their primary mode of transport. In Ho Chi Minh City, as with most other cities, scooters by far outweigh cars; over four scooters to one car. In fact this is the most shocking thing about my trip to Vietnam as the country is now mostly westernised.

I am surprised by how well scooters work in a city environment if they are the majority of vehicles on the road. Not once did I see a traffic jam at a standstill despite there being ten million inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh City. Traffic always continued to flow.

After some observation I put this amazingly efficient traffic flow down to two things:

* Scooters can fit six abreast comfortably on city streets.
* The only traffic rule observed by Vietnamese scooter riders passenger seat, I suspect the accident rate might be slightly too high for most western countries to adopt scooters to the extent Vietnam has. Added with the thought that winter riding in North America or the UK would be very chilly and uncomfortable.

However, the future is almost here. There are already self driving cars on the verge of being made commercially available, why not self driving scooters? I think Google is closest to making this a reality and I will discuss what it needs to do in another post.
