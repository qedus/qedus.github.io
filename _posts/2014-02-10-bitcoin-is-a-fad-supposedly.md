Bitcoin is a fad. This is what the former chairman of a dominant multinational investment bank told me the other day. His argument was that Bitcoin and crypto currencies in general have nothing to back them. I argued that was the same as most/all [fiat money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) by definition.

He claimed that the British Government are duty bound to buy back sterling from a customer if necessary thus giving it value. No government offers to buy back bitcoins if the market goes flat thus making it a potentially worthless fad. I asked what would the British Government buy back sterling for and he suggested it could be exchanged for other currencies.

Unfortunately I can't find any reference to this and it also does not make any sense. If your currency is going down the pan then it is worthless anyway even if your government has agreed to exchange it for another less worthless currency. Who decides the exchange rate? I bet it is a bad one.

Bitcoin seems far superior than any fiat money because it easily fulfils the requirements of a good [medium of exchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange). This utility alone gives it value. The knowledge that its value reflects true market pressures provides even more value. I fail to believe that politicians, directed by economists, really can adjust economies without harm by changing the amount of money in circulation as they do with minted currencies. I don't think they have enough foresight for such a stochastic process.

Anyway it was interesting discussing crypto currencies with a banker who was in charge of one of the financial institutes ultimately responsible for the most recent global economic downturn.
