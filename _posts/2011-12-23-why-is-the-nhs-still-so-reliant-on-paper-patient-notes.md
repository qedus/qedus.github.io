The vast majority of patient notes in [NHS](http://www.nhs.uk/) hospitals are kept in paper files. That would be fine but they cause so much trouble for clinical staff and as a consequence patient care. Notes get lost, pages go missing, writing is illegible. The list goes on and on.

We need a more efficient way of creating, storing and reading clinical data in hospitals. So why hasn't the NHS adopted the latest generation of [electronic medical record systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_medical_record) (EMR) that promise to solve all our problems? The competition is rife for EMRs in UK General Practice surgeries, so what happened to the hospital?

The easy answer is lack of money. However, I think even if the NHS had sufficient money the project would still fail. Technology is still lagging. The one overriding advantage of paper vs computer based record keeping is the ability to scribble something down at the end of a patient's bed with one hand.

A ward round consists of a doctor visiting each patient in turn, talking to them, examining them and making a plan. This process might take as little as one minute per patient. However in that time someone must take notes and record the patient's observations, write down any utterances of insight by the senior doctor, describe the positive & negative findings on examination, often with the aid of diagrams, and finally list a plan of action. This is all done in a hurry standing at the side of the bed, one hand holding the patient's notes open and the other scribbling as fast as possible. No one waits for the scribe to finish either; it's on to the next patient straight away.

Any electronic input device needs to be at least as efficient as this for clinicians to perceive a benefit, no matter how efficient it is away from the bed.

I thought tablets might be the solution in the early 2000s. They were promising and could be held in one hand while the other used a stylus to write. Unfortunately the reality was that handwriting recognition was too slow and inaccurate they had poor battery life, the stylus always went missing, wifi connection was sporadic and opening up the correct patient details was just not snappy enough. In one hospital we trialed tablet devices just for recording and viewing observations  (blood pressure, pulse, temperature etc). It was terrible for a number of reasons including the ones described above.

When the iPad came around, I had visions of each doctor having their own by their side all the time. I also assumed that Apple would create a new way of entering text, allowing the iPad to be held in one hand and the other used to type or write on the screen. I assumed that this new way of entering text would use machine learning/pattern recognition algorithms to either adjust the size and location of each virtual key, suggest correct spellings or interpret our handwriting with an acceptable level of accuracy. Instead they stayed traditional and used a QWERTY keyboard meaning that one handed text entry is very slow. Remember the QWERTY keyboard was specifically designed to be inefficient.

Speech recognition is another possible idea but Apple's Siri is just too slow to dictate notes quickly. Plus it would be irritating to have someone dictate while another person is speaking to the patient. We also still need to draw diagrams quickly.

I believe the possible solutions to this input dilemma are as follows:

* A new type of one handed virtual keyboard layout takes off allowing efficient one handed text entry. Unlikely.
* Data entry consisting of a set of smart virtual flowchart buttons. Probably too restrictive.
* Handwriting recognition. Currently too slow and inaccurate. A cloud based service needs to exist that allows users of devices requiring handwriting recognition to have their training data follow them around on each device. This would allow the pattern recognition/machine learning algorithms to be much more accurate and continually update their training sets.

I am certain future NHS clinical notes will be scribed directly onto a tablet device and paper notes will be history. Input will probably be done with a mixture of the suggestions above but mainly by handwriting recognition. Either that or the nature of hospital ward rounds will change to accommodate slower input devices - a step backwards. What ever happens I think it is important that what ever technology is chosen, it does not reduce the amount of time spent at patient bedsides.
