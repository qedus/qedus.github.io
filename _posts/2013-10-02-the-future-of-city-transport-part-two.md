The following companies should get together to solve our transportation issues:

* [Lit Motors](http://litmotors.com/) - Vehicle design.
* [Google](http://google.com/) - Autonomous driving technology.
* [Waze](href="http://waze.com/)/[Inrix](http://inrix.com/) - Vehicle networking.
* [Tesla Motors](http://teslamotors.com/) - Manufacturing.

However I think their technologies need to evolve somewhat.

## Lit Motors

Lit Motors is creating a motorbike that uses gyros to automatically stabilize it. The rider can stay completely cocooned within a protective shell without needing to put his foot down on the floor to stop the bike from falling at traffic lights.

The advantage to this design is that it is safer and more comfortable than a traditional motorbike whilst being incredibly aerodynamic, light and therefore potentially efficient.

Two things they need to work on are creating gyroscopes and batteries that are as light as can be. Large diameter lower weight gyroscopes would probably work best.

A bonus would be to reduce the number of moving parts requiring bearings. This could potentially be reduced down to two wheel axles and a steering headset. This could be achieved by making the gyros suspend magnetically and the acceleration/braking system controlled completely by electromagnetic induction directly to the 'spokes' of the front and back wheels. Having as few parts rub against each other as possible would increase efficiency and make the vehicles almost maintenance free.

## Google

Google employed the Stanford team that won the [DARPA Grand Challenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge) in 2005 and came second in the Urban Challenge in 2007. This pretty much guarantees they have the best autonomous driving technology around right now.

Combined with their Street View image data, I think they are likely to be the first to create a robust autonomous driving software/hardware package that can be retrofitted onto the Lit Motors C1 vehicle described above.

The one thing they need to do is minify the hardware requirements to allow it to unobtrusively and lightly be fitted to vehicles.

## Waze/Inrix

These companies both collect real-time road speeds from GPS based devices within vehicles such as smartphones. The data goes to central hubs where it is analysed to find traffic jams. This data is then pumped out to drivers to help them avoid the traffic.

For robustness and scalability these companies need to focus on creating a peer-to-peer protocol and canonical client that allows vehicles within vicinity of each other to agree on the best routes to take and how to avoid each other. This would allow vehicles to spread across the road network in an even manner. The protocol should be open sourced but they should focus on creating the best implementations.

## Tesla Motors

Tesla has great manufacturing facilities and knows how to integrate cutting edge technology into their vehicles. I think they would be the perfect company to integrate/copy technology from Lit Motors, Google and Waze/Inrix in order to revolutionise transport.

> Tesla needs to make vehicles like Lit but lighter and more resilient. They need to incorporate Google's self driving technology with a peer-to-peer vehicle-to-vehicle traffic avoidance system whose open-source protocol is developed by Waze/Inrix.
