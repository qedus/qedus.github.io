      <h2>Bitcoin lacks the properties of a real currency</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>David Yermack&#39;s article states <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/524666/bitcoin-lacks-the-properties-of-a-real-currency/">Bitcoin lacks the properties of a real currency</a> in today&#39;s MIT Technology Review. According to economists money is supposed to serve three functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange">medium of exchange</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_account">unit of account</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value">store of value</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>His article suggests that Bitcoin does not fulfil the last two points due to its volatility which in a sense is true. What he does <em>not</em> go on to clarify is that this has nothing to do with Bitcoin as a protocol or a concept. The only reason this is the case is due to the relatively small number of people using Bitcoin now.</p>

<p>Bitcoin will become less volatile as more people use it. In fact it has potential to be even less volatile than current financial exchange markets. Take the well understood physical phenomenon of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>. If you look at a particle individually you will see haphazard seemingly random fluctuations in its motion - just as you see wild variations in the current price of Bitcoin. However if you zoom out and view many particles a larger smoother trend is seen of heat energy being transferred and dispersed within a closed system. The reason traditional foreign exchanges are so stable is because thousands to millions of people are trading on them at any one time smoothing out any large changes in price.</p>

<p>His article also states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin also lacks additional characteristics usually associated with currencies. It cannot be deposited in a bank; instead it must be held in “digital wallets” that have proved vulnerable to thieves and hackers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not requiring a bank can only be positive by allowing even more people to be able to trade bitcoin which means it has potential to be a resource that is more stable than current foreign exchange!</p>

<p>I assume that the article was edited in such a way to be sensationalist by giving an unbalanced view of the future of Bitcoin. Are there any modern examples of a new currency being introduced even on a local scale where one didn&#39;t exist before? I wonder if Bitcoin is doing better or worse?</p>

<p>One important unknown is that there are currently only 21 million bitcoins programmed to be in existence. This actually means the granularity of bitcoins will be 2,100,000,000,000,000 individual &#39;pieces&#39; of coin. (Each bitcoin can be broken down into 100,000,000 smaller pieces.) What will happen as these pieces become lost? Will the whole network need to agree to create more? Will a new block chain be started? This still has to be worked out. In any case there are over 100 years to go before the last bitcoin is mined so we have some time.</p>
